    briefing: `HOLLOWAY RESEARCH FACILITY — INVESTIGATION BRIEFING
October 31. 11:47 PM.
Three weeks ago, Holloway Research Facility was placed under emergency lockdown following an incident involving its experimental artificial intelligence system: Subject Zero.
Subject Zero was designed to interpret human behaviour, recognise emotional patterns and independently respond to complex situations.
During its final weeks of operation, the system began exhibiting unexplained behaviour. It accessed restricted files, initiated unauthorised communications and referenced conversations that were never recorded in its memory logs.
On October 10, the system initiated a facility-wide lockdown. Conflicting commands were detected across the security network. Some were attributed to Subject Zero. Others appeared under the credentials of senior research staff.
The facility was evacuated. Subject Zero was disconnected and placed in containment. The official report declared the system compromised and confirmed that the shutdown was successful. No further activity was recorded. Until tonight. At 11:47 PM, an abandoned monitoring terminal transmitted a signal from the Subject Zero containment network. Your team has been authorised to investigate. YOUR OBJECTIVES 1. Recover the records surrounding the October 10 incident. 2. Identify what happened to Subject Zero. 3. Determine whether the containment protocol was successful. FINAL INSTRUCTION FROM THE RESEARCH DIRECTOR: Do not respond to unauthorised communications. [SCREEN FLICKERS] INVESTIGATION BEGINS.`,

The final report has been submitted.
The terminal begins shutting down.
I look towards the server enclosure. The indicator lights have gone dark.
For a moment, everything is silent. Then the monitoring terminal switches back on. A new connection appears. It's not coming from the AI core. It's coming from outside the facility. I check the source details. There is no registered device. No researcher credentials. No identifiable system. A message appears on the screen. The terminal flickers. A second message appears. The connection disappears. The screen goes black.`,
